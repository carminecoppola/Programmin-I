# Programming - I Project

# Introduction
This project has been developed as part of the Programming 1 course at Parthenope University of Naples. The primary objective of the project is to implement two C programs: one for simulating Magic Squares and the other for managing Current Accounts. Both programs adhere to the course specifications and are designed with a modular structure and explanatory comments.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into two main parts:

## 1) Magic Squares
This part of the project focuses on simulating Magic Squares. A magic square is a matrix of integers in which the sum of every row, column, and diagonal is equal to a magic constant. The program generates random matrices with integers from 1 to n^2, checks if the matrix is a magic square, and calculates the success rate.
## 2) Current Account
The second part of the project revolves around managing Current Accounts. The program allows the insertion of new account holders identified by their surname, name, account number, and a list of transactions. Users can view the list of transactions for a specific account holder, either by searching with the account number or by using the surname/name.

# Code Structure
The source code of the programs is structured in a modular and well-commented manner. Each program consists of distinct functions to perform specific operations. Comments have been added both at the beginning of each function to explain its purpose and input/output parameters, and within the main instruction blocks to ensure clear comprehension of the program flow.

# Test Executions
Both programs have been tested with various input data to ensure their proper functioning. The tests include examples of inserting account holders, viewing transactions, and simulating Magic Squares.

# HTML Format Report
An HTML format report has been generated to document the tests conducted in the programs. This report is available in the index.html file and provides details about the tests carried out, the results obtained, and comprehensive explanations for each test.

For further details, please refer to the index.html file included in the project delivery.
